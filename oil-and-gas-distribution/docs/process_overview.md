# Oil & Gas Distribution Process Overview

> **Status**: ðŸ”„ Planned - This process description is under development

## Process Description

The oil and gas distribution system implements a pipeline distribution network with pressure control and safety monitoring. This use case will demonstrate realistic oil and gas industry control scenarios with multiple control loops, safety interlocks, and security considerations.

## Planned Process Stages

1. **Inlet Processing**: Oil/gas enters the system from upstream sources
2. **Pressure Regulation**: Maintain optimal pressure for distribution
3. **Distribution**: Route product through pipeline network
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of pressure, flow, and safety parameters
5. **Safety Systems**: Emergency shutdown and pressure relief systems

## Planned Key Components

- **Pumps**: Product transfer and pressure boosting
- **Valves**: Flow control, isolation, and pressure regulation
- **Sensors**: Pressure, flow rate, temperature, leak detection
- **Pressure Regulators**: Automatic pressure control
- **Safety Systems**: Emergency shutdown, pressure relief

## Planned Control Loops

- **Pressure Control**: Maintain system pressure within safe limits
- **Flow Control**: Regulate product flow rates
- **Level Control**: Monitor storage tank levels
- **Safety Monitoring**: Continuous safety parameter monitoring

## Planned Safety Systems

- **High/Low Pressure Alarms**: Prevent over/under pressure conditions
- **Leak Detection**: Monitor for pipeline leaks
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Manual and automatic shutdown capabilities
- **Pressure Relief**: Automatic pressure relief valves

## Planned Security Considerations

- **Pressure Sensor Spoofing**: Attackers could inject false pressure readings
- **Flow Control Manipulation**: Direct control of critical valves
- **Safety Bypass Attacks**: Manipulation of safety interlocks
- **Pipeline Bypass**: Bypassing control logic and safety systems

## Planned I/O Points

The system will include approximately 12-16 I/O points:
- 6-8 Digital Inputs (sensors, alarms, manual controls)
- 4-6 Digital Outputs (valves, pumps, alarms)
- 2-3 Analog Inputs (pressure, flow rate, temperature)
- 2-3 Analog Outputs (pressure regulators, flow control valves)

## Complexity Level

**Intermediate to Advanced** - Pressure control loops, safety interlocks, and pipeline network management will make this suitable for intermediate to advanced security research and educational scenarios.
