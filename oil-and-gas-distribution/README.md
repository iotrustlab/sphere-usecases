# Oil & Gas Distribution Use Case

> **Status**: 🔄 Planned - This use case is currently under development

A pipeline distribution system with pressure control, demonstrating realistic oil and gas industry control scenarios with safety interlocks and security considerations.

## 🏭 Process Overview

Oil and gas pipeline distribution with pressure control:
- **Inlet Processing** → **Pressure Regulation** → **Distribution** → **Monitoring** → **Safety Systems**
- **Planned I/O points**: 12-16 I/O points with pressure, flow, and safety monitoring
- **Complexity**: Intermediate to Advanced (pressure control loops, safety interlocks)

## 🚀 Implementation Status

### Rockwell Implementation
- **Status**: 🔄 Planned
- **Purpose**: SPHERE testbed deployment
- **Files**: Studio 5000 L5X programs (to be developed)

### OpenPLC Implementation  
- **Status**: 🔄 Planned
- **Purpose**: Virtual simulation and local development
- **Files**: Structured Text programs, Python simulation models (to be developed)

## 🔧 Getting Started

This use case is currently in the planning phase. To contribute:

1. **Copy the template**: This use case is based on [templates/single-process/](../templates/single-process/)
2. **Develop the process**: Define the oil and gas distribution process
3. **Create implementations**: Add Rockwell and/or OpenPLC implementations
4. **Add experiments**: Develop security research scenarios

## 🛡️ Planned Safety Considerations

- **Pressure Relief**: Automatic pressure relief valves
- **Leak Detection**: Pipeline leak monitoring and alarms
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Manual and automatic shutdown capabilities
- **Flow Control**: Pressure and flow rate monitoring

## 🔬 Planned Security Experiments

### Pressure Manipulation
- **Pressure Sensor Attacks**: Manipulate pressure readings
- **Flow Rate Spoofing**: Disrupt flow control with false data
- **Safety Bypass**: Disable safety interlocks

### Pipeline Bypass
- **Direct Valve Control**: Bypass control logic for direct valve control
- **Pressure Override**: Manipulate pressure setpoints
- **Emergency Bypass**: Disable emergency shutdown systems
