# Pressure Manipulation Experiments

> **Status**: ðŸ”„ Planned - This experiment is under development

This experiment will demonstrate various pressure manipulation attacks on the oil and gas distribution system.

## Planned Attack Scenarios

### 1. Pressure Sensor Spoofing
- **Objective**: Manipulate pressure control by spoofing pressure readings
- **Method**: Inject false pressure values to trigger incorrect control responses
- **Impact**: Over/under pressure conditions, potential equipment damage

### 2. Flow Rate Spoofing
- **Objective**: Disrupt process control by manipulating flow rate readings
- **Method**: Inject false flow rate values to confuse control algorithms
- **Impact**: Incorrect valve positions, pressure variations, process instability

### 3. Safety Bypass
- **Objective**: Disable pressure safety interlocks
- **Method**: Override or disable safety alarm signals
- **Impact**: Loss of safety protection, potential system damage

## Planned Files

- `pressure_spoofing.py` - Pressure sensor spoofing attack implementation
- `flow_spoofing.py` - Flow rate spoofing attack implementation
- `safety_bypass.py` - Safety system bypass attack implementation
- `monitoring.py` - System monitoring during attacks
- `recovery.py` - System recovery procedures

## Safety Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Test in simulation only - never on physical systems
- Monitor system behavior continuously during experiments
- Have recovery procedures ready before starting experiments
- Document all observed effects and system responses
- Ensure pressure relief systems are functional
