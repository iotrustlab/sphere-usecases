# Location Attribute Fix Summary

## Problem
The generated XML files had location information as child elements (`<location>%IX2.0</location>`) which caused XML schema validation errors:
```
Element '{http://www.plcopen.org/xml/tc6_0201}variable', attribute 'location': The attribute 'location' is not allowed.
```

## Solution
After investigating the OpenPLC Editor source code, we discovered that:
1. The OpenPLC Editor uses `var.setaddress(location)` to set location information
2. Location should be an **attribute** of the `<variable>` element, not a child element
3. The sample XML file doesn't contain location elements, suggesting they're optional

## Implementation
Modified `crossplc/openplc_emitter.py` in the `_create_variable_element` method:

**Before:**
```python
# Add location element if this is an I/O variable
if hasattr(tag, 'location') and tag.location:
    location_elem = ET.SubElement(var_elem, "location")
    location_elem.text = tag.location
```

**After:**
```python
# Add location as attribute if this is an I/O variable
if hasattr(tag, 'location') and tag.location:
    var_elem.set("location", tag.location)
```

## Results
✅ **XML Schema Validation**: Both controller and simulator projects now pass validation
✅ **Location Attributes**: I/O variables now have proper `location="%IX2.0"` attributes
✅ **Coverage**: 3 mapped, 27 policy-mapped, 4 unmapped I/O references
✅ **Structure**: Variables are properly declared in both POU interface and globalVars sections

## Generated Files
- `~/Development/sphere-usecases/water-treatment/implementations/openplc/projects/controller_project/plc.xml`
- `~/Development/sphere-usecases/water-treatment/implementations/openplc/projects/simulator_project/plc.xml`

Both files now contain properly formatted location attributes and should be compatible with the OpenPLC Editor.
