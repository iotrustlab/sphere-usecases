# OpenPLC Runtime Versions
#
# This file documents tested OpenPLC versions for SPHERE CPS scenarios.
# When developing a new scenario, use one of these tested versions for stability.
# Pin scenarios to a specific commit SHA for reproducibility.

# Default version (master branch - latest)
# WARNING: master can change and break scenarios. Pin to a commit for production.

# How to find a specific commit:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v3/commits/master
# 2. Find a commit that works with your scenario
# 3. Copy the full 40-character SHA
# 4. Add it to your scenario.yaml:
#
#    nodes:
#      - name: controller
#        type: openplc
#        backend_config:
#          version: "abc123def456789..."

# Pre-built images (for faster deployment):
# Build with: ./build.sh <version> --push
# Use in scenario:
#   backend_config:
#     image: "ghcr.io/sphere-project/sphere-openplc:<version>"
