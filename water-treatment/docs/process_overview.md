# Water Treatment Process Overview

## Process Description

The water treatment facility implements a multi-stage water purification process with chemical dosing capabilities. This use case demonstrates realistic industrial control scenarios with multiple control loops, safety interlocks, and security considerations.

## Process Stages

1. **Raw Water Intake**: Water is drawn from the source and filtered
2. **Chemical Dosing**: pH adjustment and disinfection chemicals are added
3. **Mixing**: Chemicals are thoroughly mixed with the water
4. **Settling**: Suspended particles settle out
5. **Filtration**: Final filtration removes remaining particles
6. **Disinfection**: Final disinfection treatment
7. **Storage**: Treated water is stored in clean water tanks

## Key Components

- **Pumps**: Raw water intake, chemical dosing, treated water distribution
- **Valves**: Flow control, chemical injection, system isolation
- **Sensors**: Flow rate, pH, turbidity, pressure, level
- **Chemical Injectors**: pH adjustment, disinfection chemicals
- **Mixing Tanks**: Chemical mixing and settling
- **Filtration Systems**: Multi-stage filtration

## Control Loops

- **Flow Control**: Maintain consistent flow rates through the system
- **pH Control**: Automatic pH adjustment using chemical dosing
- **Level Control**: Maintain proper tank levels
- **Pressure Control**: Maintain system pressure within safe limits

## Safety Systems

- **High/Low Level Alarms**: Prevent tank overflow/underflow
- **Pressure Relief**: Automatic pressure relief valves
- **Chemical Overdose Protection**: Limit chemical injection rates
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Manual and automatic shutdown capabilities

## Security Considerations

- **Sensor Spoofing**: Attackers could inject false sensor readings
- **Pump Control Manipulation**: Direct control of critical pumps
- **Chemical Dosing Attacks**: Manipulation of chemical injection rates
- **Process Bypass**: Bypassing safety interlocks and control logic

## I/O Points

The system includes approximately 16 I/O points:
- 8 Digital Inputs (sensors, alarms, manual controls)
- 4 Digital Outputs (pumps, valves, alarms)
- 2 Analog Inputs (pH, flow rate)
- 2 Analog Outputs (chemical dosing pumps)

## Complexity Level

**Advanced** - Multiple control loops, safety interlocks, and complex process interactions make this suitable for advanced security research and educational scenarios.
