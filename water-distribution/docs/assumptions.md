# Water Distribution UC0 — Control and Simulation Assumptions

## Component wiring

- All components and wiring are defined based on the RoviSys FunctionalSpec-tags-with-wiring.pdf.
- The P&ID diagram (`water-distribution.svg`) represents the full physical layout.
- Tag names follow the `<Process>_<Component>_<Property>` convention.

## Control logic

- Control logic exists for Water Distribution (OpenPLC ST in `implementations/openplc/st/`).
- Golden runs currently use synthetic data profiles; live PLC execution is not yet used for run bundles.
- Water Treatment control logic still covers only P1 raw water intake.

## Golden runs

- Golden runs (`run-a-idle`, `run-b-flow`) use **synthetic data profiles** generated by `genruns-wd`.
- Data profiles are physically plausible but not derived from live PLC execution.
- Noise is added for realism; profiles are seeded for reproducibility.

## External references

- Standards-based reference implementations (e.g., AWWA guidelines) are not yet integrated.
- Future milestones may incorporate validated control logic from external sources.

## Simulation

- OpenPLC simulator ST exists for WD (`implementations/openplc/st/wd_simulator.st`).
- The tag contract defines the interface; mapping is aligned to the current ST addresses.
