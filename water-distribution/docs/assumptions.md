# Water Distribution UC0 — Control and Simulation Assumptions

## Component wiring

- All components and wiring are defined based on the RoviSys FunctionalSpec-tags-with-wiring.pdf.
- The P&ID diagram (`water-distribution.svg`) represents the full physical layout.
- Tag names follow the `<Process>_<Component>_<Property>` convention.

## Control logic

- Control logic implementation is **incomplete** for Water Distribution.
- No PLC program (ST or ladder) exists yet for WD; golden runs use synthetic data.
- The same applies to Water Treatment — WT control logic covers only P1 raw water intake.

## Golden runs

- Golden runs (`run-a-idle`, `run-b-flow`) use **synthetic data profiles** generated by `genruns-wd`.
- Data profiles are physically plausible but not derived from live PLC execution.
- Noise is added for realism; profiles are seeded for reproducibility.

## External references

- Standards-based reference implementations (e.g., AWWA guidelines) are not yet integrated.
- Future milestones may incorporate validated control logic from external sources.

## Simulation

- No OpenPLC or Rockwell simulation exists for WD yet.
- The tag contract defines the interface; backend mapping will be added when simulation is available.
